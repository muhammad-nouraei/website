        <section class="terms-content" id="terms-content">
<p><em>Effective Date: June 21, 2025</em></p>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By accessing or using the QuestPhone application ("App", "Service", "we", or "our"), you agree to these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum legal age in your country) to use this App. By installing or using QuestPhone, you confirm that you meet this requirement and are legally able to enter into this agreement.</p>

<h2>3. Purpose of the App</h2>
<p>QuestPhone is a custom launcher that promotes reduced screen addiction by requiring users to complete real-world challenges before accessing selected apps. Tasks are verified using technologies such as Health Connect, AI-based photo recognition ("AI Snap"), app usage monitoring, and focus modes.</p>

<h2>4. Permissions and Data Usage</h2>
<p>QuestPhone requires certain permissions to provide its core functionality. By using the App, you acknowledge and consent to the following permissions and data usage:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Usage Stats Permission:</strong>  
    This permission allows QuestPhone to detect when and how long selected apps are used. It is essential for features like tracking screen time, enforcing app restrictions, and showing insights about your app usage patterns. All app usage data is processed locally on your device and is never transmitted, stored externally, or shared with third parties.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Overlay Permission:</strong>  
    This enables QuestPhone to display content over other apps — specifically used to block or interrupt access to apps you've marked as addictive. The overlay appears in real-time when a blocked app is launched. We do not collect or view any data from the underlying app during this process.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Health Connect (Read Access Only):</strong>  
    QuestPhone integrates with Health Connect to verify the completion of real-world wellness goals — such as steps walked, water consumed, calories burned, or sleep duration. It may also be used to display health-related stats inside the app.  
    We request read-only access to specific data types required for challenge verification. Data is accessed **locally** on your device and is **never transmitted, stored externally, or shared**.  
    For progress tracking, we may store **only the dates** when you complete a task (e.g., "Hydration goal completed on July 1"). We do **not store or retain** the raw health data itself (e.g., exact number of steps or calories).
    You have full control over Health Connect access and can revoke permissions anytime via system settings.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Camera:</strong>  
    Required for the <em>AI Snap</em> feature, which verifies real-world physical tasks (like push-ups or cleaning your room) using image recognition. Photos are processed either locally or securely on-device, and are never shared or retained — unless explicitly needed for challenge verification or abuse prevention. Users are notified when the camera is active.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Notification Access:</strong>  
    Allows QuestPhone to send motivational reminders, challenge alerts, and status updates — even when you're using other apps. This helps reinforce habit-building and keep you informed without requiring constant app interaction.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Foreground Service:</strong>  
    Used to run essential features continuously in the background — such as monitoring app launches, enforcing challenge rules, and maintaining focus mode. A visible persistent notification informs users whenever the foreground service is active.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Query All Packages:</strong>  
    This permission allows QuestPhone to display a full list of apps installed on your device. It's required to let you choose which apps you want to lock, monitor, or associate with challenges. This permission is necessary for launcher functionality, and the app list is used locally only.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> No data collected by QuestPhone is sold, rented, or shared with advertisers or third parties. All permissions are solely used to power in-app features that the user explicitly activates.</p>

<h2>5. Your Responsibilities</h2>
<p>By using QuestPhone, you agree:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To use the app for its intended purpose (screen-time control and self-improvement).</li>
  <li>Not to attempt to bypass or tamper with app restrictions or challenges.</li>
  <li>To comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your region.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Health and Safety Disclaimer</h2>
<p>QuestPhone may encourage you to perform physical or wellness tasks (e.g., walking, exercising, drinking water). These suggestions are for motivational purposes only and are not a substitute for medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional before engaging in any new fitness or health routine.</p>

<h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All content, code, images, branding, and trademarks in QuestPhone are the intellectual property of their respective owners. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or use any part of the App without prior written consent.</p>

<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>QuestPhone is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. We are not responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unintended app blocks or disruptions to your workflow.</li>
  <li>Failure to meet a specific health or productivity goal.</li>
  <li>Any physical or emotional outcome resulting from tasks or quests.</li>
</ul>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, QuestPhone and its developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated via in-app notice or update logs. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

<h2>10. Termination</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to QuestPhone without prior notice if you misuse the app, violate these Terms, or use it in any harmful or abusive manner.</p>

<h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of your local jurisdiction. Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in your location.</p>

<h2>12. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback regarding these Terms, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:questphone@proton.me">questphone@proton.me</a></p>
